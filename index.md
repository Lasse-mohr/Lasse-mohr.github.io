[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)

I'm a second-year PhD student at the **Technical University of Denmark** (section for Cognitive Systems), and working closely with the Social Complexity lab and the **Center for Social Data Science** (SODAS) at Copenhagen University.
An engineer by training, my research is centered on applying methods from network science, deep learning, and dynamical systems theory to answer human-centered questions using massive datasets.

Under the guidance of Professors **Sune Lehmann** and **Morten MÃ¸rup**, I am involved in researching the intricate relationships between an individual's position in social networks and their life outcomes, a topic central to the Nation-Scale Social Networks study.
Currently, my focus is on exploring the interconnected **network dynamics**  of various layers of social networks and prediction these how they shape the lives of individuals using **graph neural network**.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work with the Business Authority of Denmark, developing automatic ** fraud detection**  systems and assessing the fiscal benefits of such initiatives.

From September 2023 to February 2024, I'm joining Professor **Alex 'Sandy' Pentland**  and his team at the **MIT Media Lab** in Boston, US.
In collaboration with Isabella Loaiza from MIT Sloan and the Human Dynamics Laboratory, we aim to unravel the nuances of mobility and career shifts on worker salaries, aiming to foster better conditions for low-wage workers.
